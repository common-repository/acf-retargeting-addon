This plugin requires <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/">Advanced Custom Fields</a> to work.<br> It enables you to add tracking and retargeting code to individual posts and pages.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to easily add retargeting pixels to individual Wordpress pages and posts. 

The reason for this is so that you can create specific adverts to target people that visit certain pages.

As I started to embark on the world of paid traffic I realised that retargeting offered a much higher yield in terms of click throughs.

To help maximise my advertising budget I looked into how retargeting worked and found that I would need to create campaigns for each of my landing pages / products.

It was at this point I realised, I can add tracking code to the head or footer of the site but what about individual pages.

I started to look at options and found very little offering help about retargeting and individual page tracking.

There was a great looking plugin called css-javascript-toolbox but it did not work with the theme that I was using and after talking to the developer I decided that I needed to create my own very simple option.

I was going to use custom capabilities and just add a call into the head but I realised that whilst this would be good for me it would not serve my customers so I set out to create a simple way to allows others to do this.

My first step was to add the plugin Advanced Custom Fields

Once I had this I then created a custom capability that was relevant to what I needed. The plugin has an awesome feature of exporting PHP so I took the code and added it to a plugin. I then called the plugin into the head but only if ACF is first installed.
